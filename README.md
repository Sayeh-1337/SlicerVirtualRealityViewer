# SlicerVirtualRealityViewer
VR interface for 3D Slicer medical software platform

Hacky method for viewing 3D Slicer scenes with a VR headset (https://youtu.be/p2U-5tOi23o). Not meant to be used out of the box.

Slicer module produces a cubemap that the Unity scene can capture (using a virtual webcam that isn't included, but software like xsplit works).
The Unity scene was originally developed to work with the Oculus Rift DK2. It would likely work with other headsets but needs some modification.
